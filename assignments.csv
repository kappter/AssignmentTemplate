You need to explain the stages of photosynthesis and the role of chlorophyll.","Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organisms' activities. This energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water. The stages of photosynthesis include: Light-dependent reactions, Calvin cycle (light-independent reactions). Chlorophyll is the pigment that gives plants their green color and is crucial for absorbing light energy."
